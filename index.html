                            James isn't very good at writing about himself, but he'll give it his best shot anyway.
                            Raised in Colorado, he attended the University of Groningen in the North of the Netherlands 
                            where he obtained a degree in Politics, Philosophy and Economics.
                            Supposedly it's a common name for a degree over there, 
                            but James thinks they could have gotten away with just calling it political Econonomy. 
                            He likes the subject, but he likes coding more.
