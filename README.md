## Installation

This project is live on github pages, and the code can be viewed on the repo.
[github repo here](https://github.com/jamesyoungGHusername/portfolio)

[github pages deployment here](https://jamesyoungghusername.github.io/portfolio/)

## Usage
Resizing the window, or viewing the page on a small screen (mobile) reformats some elements to stack vertically instead of horizontally. Mousover functionality to highlight projets is in the code, but was turned off for the first project in the interests of adhering to the requirements detailed in this assignment's readme.
